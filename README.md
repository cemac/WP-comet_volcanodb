## WP-comet_volcanodb

This WordPress plugin is designed to allow embedding of the COMET Volcano Deformation Database within a WordPress site.

Once installed and activated, an extra item, *COMET Volcano DB*, will appear in the WordPress *Settings* menu.

The following configuration options are available for the plugin:

  * **Base path** : The base URL path of the WordPress site which will be used for embedding the site. For example, a setting of `volcanodb` would make the content available at `http://wordpress-site/volcanodb`.
  * **Remote site** : The address of the remote site to be embedded, e.g. `https://comet-volcanodb.org`.
  * **SSL verify** : Whether the WordPress server should verify web certificates when retrieving the remote content.
